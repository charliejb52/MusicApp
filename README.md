## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy your project URL and anon key from the dashboard
3. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

```

### 3. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
